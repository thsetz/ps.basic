Description: Introduction
        ============
        The ps.basic package holds code for the basic building blocks within the "ps".
        cc
        
        These are:
        
            - a singleton (class **Basic**), which is used to setup a "ps-component" e.g. a service
              in a consistent manner
        
              - using this class the component adapts easily to the surrounding ps-deployment monitor
              - using this class the component adapts easily to the surrounding mechanisms to handle config files
              - using this class the component adapts easily to the surrounding mechanisms for different production_environments/stages
        
            - a python function  to send mails (having an exception handler trying to send the mail via shell)
        
            - an easier interface for calling a shell
        
            - basics to implement and document finite state machines
        
            - some other small helper  functions
        
        
        The usage of this package is closely related to the usage of the ps.herald package with adds a (via ssh tunnels distributed usable)
        monitoring environment based on the here implemented Basics.
